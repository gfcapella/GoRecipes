# GoRecipies

[Go](https://golang.org) is an easy to learn language, but deviates from the [Object Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) paradigm we see in languages like [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) or [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). This can make you feel insecure, as you can't rely on many of the lessons you learnt during your career. 
Here you find a collection of the recipes I find most useful when coding.
